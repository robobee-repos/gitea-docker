# Gitea

## Description

The image modifies the base image and adds the option to have a input directory for configuration files that can be used with Kubernetes Config Map. In addition, it adds rsync to synchronize the Gitea public files from `/usr/src/gitea/public` to `/var/www/html` the web root directory. That is necessary if the web root directory is mounted as a Kubernetes Persistent Volume.

## Directories

| Path | Description |
